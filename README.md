# Resume-Scanner-for-Job-Description

### A resume keyword scanner is software job hiring sites use to look for specified keywords in resumes and then sort those applications into groups based on the results. It then matches qualified applicants to jobs for a hiring manager to review. Also known as applicant tracking systems (ATS), its parameters are set by the recruiters and businesses seeking applicants. 

### The larger the organization, the more likely it is to use ATS, but the majority of job sites do use resume keyword scanner software today.
